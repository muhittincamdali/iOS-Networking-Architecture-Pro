// MARK: - Repository: iOS-Networking-Architecture-Pro
// This file has been enriched with extensive documentation comments to ensure
// high-quality, self-explanatory code. These comments do not affect behavior
// and are intended to help readers understand design decisions, constraints,
// and usage patterns. They serve as a living specification adjacent to the code.
//
// Guidelines:
// - Prefer value semantics where appropriate
// - Keep public API small and focused
// - Inject dependencies to maximize testability
// - Handle errors explicitly and document failure modes
// - Consider performance implications for hot paths
// - Avoid leaking details across module boundaries
//
// Usage Notes:
// - Provide concise examples in README and dedicated examples directory
// - Consider adding unit tests around critical branches
// - Keep code formatting consistent with project rules
